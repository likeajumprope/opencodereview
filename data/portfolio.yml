          Normative modelling is an emerging method in neuroimaging to model individualized differences beyond group average comparisons.
          Normative modelling maps the variation of one dimension onto a second, normalizing for the variation in this dimension. In this project I develop 
          and test a version of a normative model using a hierarchial Gaussian process to use normative modelling for site effect correction in multi-site
          neuroimaging.

          Both the treatment and the neuro-anatomy underlying depression are little understood. This can be attributed to the heterogeneity of depression,
          combined with the research approach of group average comparisons which cover many inter-individual differences. Normative modelling allows to map variation
          at an individual level as z-scores of deviations.

          With raising awareness about the multi-site effect problem, several methods have been developed to 
          correct for this issue. But which method should be used in which situation? What are the exact mathematical underpinnings
          of each method? This is what we are trying to discuss in this paper.
