        description: |
          Normative modelling is an emerging method in neuroimaging to model individualized differences beyond group average comparisons.
          Normative modelling maps the variation of one dimension onto a second, normalizing for the variation in this dimension. In this project I develop 
          and test a version of a normative model using a hierarchial Gaussian process to use normative modelling for site effect correction in multi-site
          neuroimaging.
