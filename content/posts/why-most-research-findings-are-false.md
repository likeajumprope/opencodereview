In his famous paper ["Why most research findings are false"](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) John Ionnidis proofs that most research findings are false. Given that his paper is quite technical, I will go over his rationale here again.

The first concept that is introduced is *R* which is considered to be *the relationship between "true relationships" and "no relationships"* in all tests in a certain field.

So, when the number of true relationships in a field = 0.3 and the number of no relationships = 0.7 then:
