![Failure and success](/static/images/failure.jpeg)
Last summer I was recruited via LinkedIn to work for a machine-learning-oriented startup. To summarize: It was a catastrophe that lasted two months due to mis-management of the founder. 
 Based on this experience, I have collated some piece of advice on how to NOT start a startup[^1].


1. Start with a minimal viable product.
A successful startup begins with a minimal viable product (MVP), not with a vision nor with money. You might have a vision and $500000 in funding, but if you do not have an idea what you what to sell to a customer in the end, it is quite easy to blow through the money and be left with nothing at the end. For example, if your vision is to revolutionize the mental health diagnostic system with machine learning and you have substantial funding - what is your product in the end? 
So: be as precise as possible. Think about what it will be that you will hand over to the client in the end.

2. Keep it low-cost at the beginning. 

3. Have a good communication system.
