### 2. The relationship between power, sample size, effect size and type I error alpha

A second very important concept is the relationship of certain probabilities within the framework of statistical hypothesis testing.

| Type of choice      | Null hypothesis                 Alternative hypothesis  |
|:--------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Erroneous choice    | type I error (alpha)          | type II error (beta)     ||
| Correct choice      | correctly accept the line\     | correctly accept the    |
|                     | null hypothesis               |alternative hypothesis (power)|

Alpha is the level of significance that is used to determine whether a null hypothesis can be rejected. Power (1- beta) is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
